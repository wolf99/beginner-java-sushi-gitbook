1. To write some Java code we can use a simple **text editor**, such as Notepad. If you already have an **integrated development environment** \(IDE\) that you would like to use, you can use that also but it is not required. Open your chosen editor and save begin by saving the blank file with the filename `HelloWorld.java`. Be sure that the name is spelled correctly and has the correct case as this important for later on. The `.java` part is the** file extension**. Normally files saved in a text editor may be saved with a `.txt` extension so you will need to make sure the extension is definitely changed to `.java`.
2. Java is an **object orientated programming** \(OOP\) language, that is the program is constructed out of code constructs we call **objects** where a particular type of object may have some data and some behaviour associated with it.
3. A program that is object orientated is one that creates and uses these objects to achieve the functionality required.
4. We can design each type of object that we want by creating a **class**. A class is like a blueprint or plan for how the program should create that type of object. For example, if we want to create a program for counting chairs. We might create a class called chair. In Java we would do that like this:
