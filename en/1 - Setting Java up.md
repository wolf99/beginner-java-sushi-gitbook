1. Java is platform independent. This means that it will run on nearly any operating system. Whether your computer runs Windows, Linux, Mac OS, it's all the same to Java! The reason it can run on any operating system is because of the **Java Virtual Machine**. The Virtual Machine is a programme that processes all your Java code correctly. So you need to install this programme \(Virtual Machine\) before you can run any Java code.
2. Java is owned by a company called Oracle, so you need to head over to Oracle's website to get the Java Virtual Machine, also known as the **Java Runtime Environment** \(JRE\). Try this page first: [http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp](http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp)
3. You can check to see if you already have the JRE on your computer by clicking the link "Do I have Java?". You'll find this link under the big Download button at the top of the page. When you click the link, your computer will be scanned for the JRE. You will then be told whether you have it or not. If not, you'll be given the opportunity to download and install it.
4. An alternative way to check if you already have the JRE is to open a **command prompt** or **terminal** and type in the command: `java -version `If you have java installed the command will display the current java version \(_check yours is up to date_\), if you do not have it installed it will likely tell you that the command is not recognised.
5. To select the installer yourself head over to this page: [http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp](http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
6. After downloading and installing, you may need to restart you computer. When you do, you will have the Java Virtual Machine!
